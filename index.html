      <h3>Basketball Statistic Record</h3>
      <img src="Assets/project1.png" class="modal-img" />
      <p>This was my final performance task during my 2nd semester in first-year college.
        Built in Java with a GUI interface, the project was designed to record and manage basketball player statistics in real time. <br><br>
        The system allows officiating staff to input and track stats such as points, assists, rebounds, steals, blocks, and fouls with also the help of ArrayList.
        By replacing manual paper-based stat sheets, the system speeds up data entry and ensures accuracy during games.
        Using conditions and logical operators, the program can calculate team stats, determine standout players, and generate a points-based system for ranking. 
        The result is a more efficient and organized way to handle game data.</p>

      <h3>Bella Ciao Cafe Ordering System</h3>
      <img src="Assets/project2.png" class="modal-img" />
      <p>This project was developed for our 1st Semester Final Performance Task in college.
        The goal was to create a working system for a real business in our town. 
        We partnered with Bella Ciao Cafe, a local shop known for its aesthetic and professional ambiance. <br><br>
        After gathering the necessary data from the cafe, my partner created a detailed UI/UX mockup and
        prototype based on the system's specific needs—including colors, fonts, and layout structure.
        I then translated the design into functional code using Java. <br><br>
        The system is designed for cashiers to easily list, find, remove and track customer orders more efficiently than traditional handwritten notes.  
        I used CRUD functionality using ArrayList and followed Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, as required by our project rubrics.
        I also used conditions and operators to handle price calculations and change output, and integrated
        file handling to generate order receipt, helping both the cashier and customers track and organize transactions in real time.</p>

      <h3>Kopra Price Conversion</h3>
      <img src="Assets/project3.png" class="modal-img" />
      <p>This was my first project as a freelance Java developer, created for a client who needed a console-based program as part of their school requirements.
        Since the project didn't require a user interface, I used ASCII design elements to make the console layout more visually appealing and structured. <br><br>
        The system calculates the price of kopra, whether it's still on the tree or already processed, and includes a feature to compute the
        profit-sharing percentage between farmers and their laborers using conditions and operations. Furthermore, I used OOP principle to make the code clean, organized, and easy to maintain.
        Additionally, I implemented file handling to generate service receipts for each transaction, making the system more practical and professional even with only in console-based system. <br><br>
        This program is especially useful for kopra who want a simple, efficient way to handle pricing and profit distribution.</p>

      <h3>Eggs Flowershop Inventory</h3>
      <img src="Assets/project4.png" class="modal-img" />
      <p>This project was developed for a Fiverr client who needed an ordering system for their flower shop.
        The client provided a mockup prototype and a specific hex color palette to match the desired design.
        I built the system using Java with a graphical user interface (GUI), as requested. <br><br>
        The program allows the cashier to manage product availability, input customer orders based on
        product type and floral design, and automatically calculate total costs.
        I implemented full CRUD functionality using ArrayList to easily add, track, and update products.
        Conditional statements and operators were used to calculate and validate orders efficiently.
        Additionally, I added an order receipt feature using file handling, giving the system a more professional touch.
        This solution significantly improves the ordering process compared to traditional paper-based methods.</p>

      <img src="Assets/project5.png" class="modal-img" />
      <p>The Soil Nutrient Analyzer is a Figma prototype that simulates a smart soil-testing app using a pen-like device.
        It guides users through a 4-step flow: starting the analysis, simulating the test, showing soil type and NPK nutrient levels, and offering fertilizer recommendations.<br><br>
        Designed with a clean and intuitive interface, the app helps users—especially farmers—make better decisions about soil health and fertilizer use.
        It demonstrates how simple technology can support smart, sustainable agriculture.</p>

      <p>This portfolio project was our final performance task for Web Development. My classmate asked for
        help in building a simple portfolio based on her mockup prototype. I developed the site using
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind as the foundation. <br><br>
        To improve usability, I integrated EmailJS for the contact form, making it easier for clients to get in touch with her.
        I also refined the contact section by replacing plain text links with social media icons, which better complemented the
        design and gave the site a more professional and modern feel. In recognition of my work, I received extra allowance for helping with the project.</p>

      <p>This portfolio was also part of our final performance task for our Web Development subject.
        My classmate already had an existing web portfolio, but due to additional requirements set by our professor,
        he asked for my help to update and enhance it. <br><br>
        The original version only included a hero landing page and a project section.
        I added a new Services page to showcase his current skills and the types of work he can offer clients,
        as well as a Contact section with links to his social media, email address, and Facebook page highlighting his design work.
        I also integrated EmailJS to allow more convenient client communication.</p>

      <p>One of my classmates also asked for help enhancing an existing admin dashboard assigned by our professor as our final performance task in Web Development.
        The goal was to improve the layout and add new features to make it look more professional and responsive. <br><br>
        The original dashboard had a basic design with limited functionality. I applied a monochrome blue theme using a specific hex color palette provided by my classmate.
        I also added interactive graphs that respond when clicking on summary cards (Users, Visits, Revenue), showing trends across weekly, monthly, and yearly views.
        Additionally, I created a new “Users” section in the navigation, which displays user info and profile pictures, highlights recently added accounts,
        and includes features to view details and delete users.</p>
